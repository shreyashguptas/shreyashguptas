## Tech Philosophy
Building solutions to problems that I and people around me face. If we are facing a problem, we are probably not the only ones.

## Personal
Driven by a relentless curiosity about the world. My interests primarily revolve around technology, business, economics, history, and politics. If a topic doesn't relate to these areas, I am bored.
